It showcases personal information, skills, experiences, education, and past projects, 
and includes a contact form powered by Google Apps Script to send form data to Google Sheets.

6. **Contact Section** - Includes contact info and a form integrated with Google Sheets.
7. **Google Apps Script** - Handles form submission without needing backend hosting.

📥 FORM SUBMISSION:
-------------------
The contact form uses this script URL:
(https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzAqo5CAHrp08hWyxCPlimVxcYLDOPoAd9M9lZtUyhninmjo4HhB2kApyFar3jl0tVfeQ/exec)

⚠️ NOTE: 
If you see a warning like “Google hasn’t verified this app,” 
it means the Google Apps Script is not yet verified by Google. 
You can still use it by clicking “Advanced” > “Go to project (unsafe)” if it's your own script.

🛠 HOW TO USE:
--------------
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser to view.
3. To edit contact form data submission:
   - Replace the scriptURL in the JS with your own Google Apps Script.
4. Replace images and texts to personalize.
5. Make sure to host `CV.pdf` and `logo.png` in the correct folders.

🎨 CUSTOMIZATION:
-----------------
- Update styles in `style.css` as needed.
- Replace icons using Font Awesome classes.
- Change project images and links inside the Portfolio section.
- Update social links and contact info.

✅ CREDITS:
-----------
- Font Awesome (for icons)
